I made this DIY guitar distortion pedal from scratch using analog electronic parts and a custom-designed printed circuit board. The goal of this project was to learn how audio signals can be changed using electronic circuits to create distortion effects often used in electric guitars.

The pedal takes a clean signal from the guitar and sends it through several stages involving resistors, capacitors, and diode clipping components.
The diode clipping part intentionally cuts parts of the sound wave, which changes the original signal and creates the distorted "crunch" or overdrive sound commonly used in rock and metal music.

I created and used my own PCB layout to properly connect the input, clipping stage, filtering parts, and output.
This helped make the signal more stable, reduce unwanted noise, and make the circuit smaller and more dependable for real use.

Through this project, I got hands-on experience with analog audio processing, PCB design, building circuits, and fixing hardware issues.
